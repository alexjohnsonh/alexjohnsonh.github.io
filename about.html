          <h1>About</h1>
          <p>As a designer and colour enthusiast, I've always been fascinated by the impact that colours have on our emotions, perceptions, and behaviors. However, when I began exploring this topic in depth, I noticed a lack of comprehensive, engaging resources that made colour psychology accessible and applicable to designers, marketers, and curious individuals alike. Inspired by this gap, I set out to create a platform that would empower others to harness colours power in their own creative endeavors.</p>
          <p>One of the unique aspects of this website is the interactive bubble feature, designed to make your learning experience more engaging and enjoyable. As you navigate the homepage, you'll notice colourful bubbles. Simply click on these bubbles to reveal fascinating insights, historical context, and practical applications related to each colour. This feature allows you to explore the content at your own pace and discover hidden gems of knowledge that will deepen your understanding of colour psychology.</p>
          <p>This website was developed as part of a class project, which allowed me to combine my passion for colour psychology with my growing skills in web design and development. Throughout the process, I gained valuable knowledge and experience in creating user-friendly, informative, and a visually appealing website.</p>
