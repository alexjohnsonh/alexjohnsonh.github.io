        <h1>Blue in Design</h1>
      <p>Blue is often used in the technology and communication industries to create a sense of trust, reliability, and professionalism, as seen in the branding of Facebook and Intel.

        <h1>Colour Theory</h1>
        <p>Colour theory is the study of how colours interact with each other and how they can be used to create certain visual effects. It involves understanding the relationships between colours, such as complementary colours, analogous colours, split complimentary colours and triadic colours.</p>

        <p><b>Complementary colours</b> are pairs of colours that are opposite each other on the colour wheel. When used together, complementary colours create a high contrast and a vibrant, dynamic effect. They can be used to create bold and striking designs or to draw attention to specific elements.</p>

        <div id="circle2"></div>
        <div id="circle4"></div>
        <p><b>Analogous colours</b> are groups of three colours that are adjacent to each other on the colour wheel. Analogous colours create a harmonious and cohesive look, as they share a common hue. They can be used to create a sense of unity and balance in a design.</p>

        <div id="circle2"></div>
        <div id="circle6"></div>
        <p><b>Split complementary colours</b> are a variation of the complementary colour scheme. It involves selecting a base colour and then using the two colours adjacent to its complement on the colour wheel. This colour scheme offers a similar high contrast effect as complementary colours but with a slightly more subtle and less jarring result.</p>

        <div id="circle8"></div>
        <p><b>Triadic colours</b> are three colours that are evenly spaced on the colour wheel, forming a triangle. Triadic colours create a vibrant and dynamic effect, as they offer a balanced contrast. They can be used to create striking and bold designs or to convey a sense of energy and excitement.</p>
        <p>Understanding these colour relationships is essential for creating effective and visually appealing designs. By using complementary, analogous, split complementary, or triadic colour schemes, designers can create a wide range of visual effects and evoke specific emotions or moods.</p>
