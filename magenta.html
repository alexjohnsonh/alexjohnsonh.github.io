          <h1>Pink</h1>
          <p>Pink is a soft, warm colour that is created by mixing red and white. It can range from a pale, light hue to a deeper, more vibrant shade.</p>
          <p>The use of pink in art and fashion has evolved over time. In the 18th century, pink was considered a masculine colour, worn by both men and women. However, in the 20th century, pink became more associated with femininity, particularly after the introduction of the iconic Barbie doll in the 1950s. Pink has also been used in various social and political movements, such as the pink ribbon for breast cancer awareness.</p>
          <p>Pink is often associated with love, romance, and tenderness. It is known to have a calming effect and is sometimes used in spaces designed to promote relaxation, such as nurseries and spas. Pink is also associated with kindness, compassion, and nurturing. In marketing, pink is often used to target female audiences and convey a sense of sweetness and playfulness.</p>

        <h1>Pink in Design</h1>
        <p>Pink is often used in the fashion and beauty industries to create a sense of femininity, romance, and playfulness, as seen in the branding of Victoria's Secret and Barbie. In design, pink is also used to convey compassion and nurturing, making it a popular choice for brands in the healthcare and childcare industries, such as Susan G. Komen and Johnson's Baby.</p>
        <h1>Colour Theory</h1>
        <p>Colour theory is the study of how colours interact with each other and how they can be used to create certain visual effects. It involves understanding the relationships between colours, such as complementary colours, analogous colours, split complimentary colours and triadic colours.</p>

        <p><b>Complementary colours</b> are pairs of colours that are opposite each other on the colour wheel. When used together, complementary colours create a high contrast and a vibrant, dynamic effect. They can be used to create bold and striking designs or to draw attention to specific elements.</p>
        <div id="circle3"></div>
        <div id="circle2"></div>
        <div id="circle4"></div>
        <p><b>Analogous colours</b> are groups of three colours that are adjacent to each other on the colour wheel. Analogous colours create a harmonious and cohesive look, as they share a common hue. They can be used to create a sense of unity and balance in a design.</p>

        <div id="circle2"></div>
        <div id="circle6"></div>
        <p><b>Split complementary colours</b> are a variation of the complementary colour scheme. It involves selecting a base colour and then using the two colours adjacent to its complement on the colour wheel. This colour scheme offers a similar high contrast effect as complementary colours but with a slightly more subtle and less jarring result.</p>

        <div id="circle8"></div>
        <p><b>Triadic colours</b> are three colours that are evenly spaced on the colour wheel, forming a triangle. Triadic colours create a vibrant and dynamic effect, as they offer a balanced contrast. They can be used to create striking and bold designs or to convey a sense of energy and excitement.</p>
        <p>Understanding these colour relationships is essential for creating effective and visually appealing designs. By using complementary, analogous, split complementary, or triadic colour schemes, designers can create a wide range of visual effects and evoke specific emotions or moods.</p>
