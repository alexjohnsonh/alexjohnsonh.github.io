          <h1>Red</h1>
          <p>Red is a warm, intense colour that is often associated with strong emotions and actions.</p>
          <p>Red has been a significant colour throughout human history. In prehistoric times, red ochre was used in cave paintings. Ancient Egyptians associated red with life, health, and victory. In China, red is the colour of good luck and celebration. During the Renaissance, red was a symbol of power and wealth. In the 20th century, red became associated with communism and revolution.</p>
          <p>Red is known to have a profound effect on the human psyche. It can increase heart rate, blood pressure, and respiration, creating a sense of excitement and urgency. Red is often associated with passion, love, desire, anger, aggression, and danger. In many cultures, red is also linked to courage, sacrifice, and leadership.</p>

        <h1>Red in Design</h1>
        <p>Red is often used in the food industry, particularly in fast-food restaurants like McDonald's, as it is known to stimulate appetite and create a sense of urgency. In design, red is also used to convey passion, energy, and excitement, making it a popular choice for brands in the entertainment and sports industries, such as Netflix and Coca-Cola.</p>
        <h1>Colour Theory</h1>
        <p>Colour theory is the study of how colours interact with each other and how they can be used to create certain visual effects. It involves understanding the relationships between colours, such as complementary colours, analogous colours, split complimentary colours and triadic colours.</p>

        <p><b>Complementary colours</b> are pairs of colours that are opposite each other on the colour wheel. When used together, complementary colours create a high contrast and a vibrant, dynamic effect. They can be used to create bold and striking designs or to draw attention to specific elements.</p>

        <div id="circle4"></div>
        <p><b>Analogous colours</b> are groups of three colours that are adjacent to each other on the colour wheel. Analogous colours create a harmonious and cohesive look, as they share a common hue. They can be used to create a sense of unity and balance in a design.</p>

        <div id="circle6"></div>
        <p><b>Split complementary colours</b> are a variation of the complementary colour scheme. It involves selecting a base colour and then using the two colours adjacent to its complement on the colour wheel. This colour scheme offers a similar high contrast effect as complementary colours but with a slightly more subtle and less jarring result.</p>

        <div id="circle8"></div>
        <p><b>Triadic colours</b> are three colours that are evenly spaced on the colour wheel, forming a triangle. Triadic colours create a vibrant and dynamic effect, as they offer a balanced contrast. They can be used to create striking and bold designs or to convey a sense of energy and excitement.</p>
        <p>Understanding these colour relationships is essential for creating effective and visually appealing designs. By using complementary, analogous, split complementary, or triadic colour schemes, designers can create a wide range of visual effects and evoke specific emotions or moods.</p>
