          <h1>Purple</h1>
          <p>Purple is a rich, deep color that is created by mixing red and blue. It can range from a light, lavender hue to a deep, royal shade.</p>
          <p>Throughout history, purple has been associated with royalty, nobility, and wealth. In ancient times, purple dye was rare and expensive, making it a symbol of status and power. In the Middle Ages, purple was worn by members of the royal family and high-ranking officials in the Catholic Church. In the 1960s and 1970s, purple became associated with the counterculture movement and psychedelic art.</p>
          <p>Purple is often associated with creativity, mystery, and spirituality. It is known to stimulate the imagination and inspire creative thinking. Purple is also associated with luxury, sophistication, and elegance. In marketing, purple is often used to convey a sense of exclusivity, quality, and prestige. However, overuse of purple can sometimes be perceived as arrogant or artificial.</p>

        <h1>Colour Theory</h1>
        <p>Colour theory is the study of how colours interact with each other and how they can be used to create certain visual effects. It involves understanding the relationships between colours, such as complementary colours, analogous colours, split complimentary colours and triadic colours.</p>
        <img src="./Colours/violet 1.png" alt="Complementary Colours">
        <p><b>Complementary colours</b> are pairs of colours that are opposite each other on the colour wheel. When used together, complementary colours create a high contrast and a vibrant, dynamic effect. They can be used to create bold and striking designs or to draw attention to specific elements.</p>
        <img src="./Colours/violet 2.png" alt="Analogous Colours">
        <p><b>Analogous colours</b> are groups of three colours that are adjacent to each other on the colour wheel. Analogous colours create a harmonious and cohesive look, as they share a common hue. They can be used to create a sense of unity and balance in a design.</p>
        <img src="./Colours/violet 3.png" alt="Split Complementary Colours">
        <p><b>Split complementary colours</b> are a variation of the complementary colour scheme. It involves selecting a base colour and then using the two colours adjacent to its complement on the colour wheel. This colour scheme offers a similar high contrast effect as complementary colours but with a slightly more subtle and less jarring result.</p>
        <img src="./Colours/violet 4.png" alt="Triadic Colours">
        <p><b>Triadic colours</b> are three colours that are evenly spaced on the colour wheel, forming a triangle. Triadic colours create a vibrant and dynamic effect, as they offer a balanced contrast. They can be used to create striking and bold designs or to convey a sense of energy and excitement.</p>
        <p>Understanding these colour relationships is essential for creating effective and visually appealing designs. By using complementary, analogous, split complementary, or triadic colour schemes, designers can create a wide range of visual effects and evoke specific emotions or moods.</p>
