          <h1>Orange</h1>
          <p>Orange is a warm, vibrant colour that is created by mixing red and yellow.</p>
          <p>Orange has been used throughout history to symbolise energy, creativity, and change. In ancient civilisations, orange was associated with the sun and the harvest. In the 20th century, orange became associated with the counterculture movement and psychedelic art.</p>
          <p>Orange is known to stimulate mental activity and evoke a sense of enthusiasm and adventure. It is often associated with creativity, youth, and fun. Orange is believed to increase oxygen supply to the brain, stimulate mental activity, and encourage communication and social interaction. Due to its bold nature, orange also symbolises caution and is used for road cones, traffic signs, and safety gear to grab attention and alert people to potential hazards. In marketing, orange is used to create a friendly, approachable, and energetic image, particularly for brands targeting younger audiences or promoting outdoor activities and sports. However, overuse of orange can be overwhelming and may lead to feelings of frustration or impatience.</p>

        <h1>Orange in Design</h1>
      <p>Orange, when combined with black, is often used to convey a sense of caution or warning, as seen in traffic cones and safety gear. In design, orange is also used to create a friendly and approachable atmosphere, making it a popular choice for brands in the technology and communication industries, such as Amazon and Nickelodeon.</p>
        <h1>Colour Theory</h1>
        <p>Colour theory is the study of how colours interact with each other and how they can be used to create certain visual effects. It involves understanding the relationships between colours, such as complementary colours, analogous colours, split complimentary colours and triadic colours.</p>
        <img src="./Colours/orange 1.png" alt="Complementary Colours">
        <p><b>Complementary colours</b> are pairs of colours that are opposite each other on the colour wheel. When used together, complementary colours create a high contrast and a vibrant, dynamic effect. They can be used to create bold and striking designs or to draw attention to specific elements.</p>
        <img src="./Colours/orange 2.png" alt="Analogous Colours">
        <p><b>Analogous colours</b> are groups of three colours that are adjacent to each other on the colour wheel. Analogous colours create a harmonious and cohesive look, as they share a common hue. They can be used to create a sense of unity and balance in a design.</p>
        <img src="./Colours/orange 3.png" alt="Split Complementary Colours">
        <p><b>Split complementary colours</b> are a variation of the complementary colour scheme. It involves selecting a base colour and then using the two colours adjacent to its complement on the colour wheel. This colour scheme offers a similar high contrast effect as complementary colours but with a slightly more subtle and less jarring result.</p>
        <img src="./Colours/orange 4.png" alt="Triadic Colours">
        <p><b>Triadic colours</b> are three colours that are evenly spaced on the colour wheel, forming a triangle. Triadic colours create a vibrant and dynamic effect, as they offer a balanced contrast. They can be used to create striking and bold designs or to convey a sense of energy and excitement.</p>
        <p>Understanding these colour relationships is essential for creating effective and visually appealing designs. By using complementary, analogous, split complementary, or triadic colour schemes, designers can create a wide range of visual effects and evoke specific emotions or moods.</p>
